### 👀 Interests & Motivation

I'm deeply interested in computing and technology, and I thrive on solving technical challenges. My journey began as a System Administrator and Developer, where I discovered a passion for building solutions from the ground up. I enjoy translating ideas and requirements into effective, real-world solutions.

Over time, I’ve come to understand the gap between academic knowledge and real-world professional experience—both are important, but my drive comes from where I want to go, not just where I’ve started.

### 🌱 What I’m Learning

I'm regularly expanding my skills in:

* **Data Management and Analysis (Data Science)**
* **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**
* **UI Development with modern framework**
* Mastering tools and technologies to manage and analyze large datasets using statistical and machine learning techniques

### 💞️ Collaboration & Goals

I’m looking to collaborate with others to grow professionally, contribute to meaningful projects, and strengthen my skillset along the way.
